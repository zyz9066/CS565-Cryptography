a few algorithms of number theory

* Euclidean Algorithm: compute the greatest common divisor of two positive integers *a* and *b*
* Extended Euclidean Algorithm: take two integers *a* and *b* as input and compute integers *r*, *s* and *t* such that *r*=gcd(*a*,*b*) and *sa*+*tb*=r
* Square and Multiply Algorithm: compute modular exponentiations for large number in RSA cryptosystem
* Solovay-Strassen Algorithm: evaluate Jacobi symbol without factoring *n*
* Chinese Remainder Theorem: solve simultaneous congruence *x*=*a_1* mod *m_1*, *x*=*a_2* mod *m_2*, ..., *x*=*a_n* mod *m_n*
